## IRIS Tutorial: Unit Root Models

In this tutorial, we show how to build and handle models with unit-root
variables, such as balanced-growth path models. In IRIS, unit-root models
do not need to be stationarized, and can be built, simulated and analyzed
with the variables in their original levels.

Start in `Contents.m`.
