%% Simple exogenous growth model code: Stationarized
%
% In this model code, we stationarize the unit-root variables (output,
% consumption, investment, capital) by dividing them by the level of
% productivity. The properties of this version of the model are identical
% to the properties of the model with unit roots preserved,
% `exogenousGrowth.model`.

%% Declare transition (aka endogenous) variables

!transition-variables

    "Output to Productivity" y, "Consumption to Productivity" c, "Investment to Productivity" i
    "Capital to Productivity" k, "Labor" L
    "Rate of Change in Productivity" dA
    "Real Rate of Interest" r
%


%% Declare parameters

!parameters

    g, gamma, delta, beta
%


%% Declare shocks to transition equations

!transition-shocks

    "Productivity Shock" u
%


%% Write transition (aka endogenous) equations

!transition-equations

    c{1}/c * dA{1} = beta*(1 + r);
    L = 1;

    y = L^gamma * (k{-1}/dA)^(1-gamma);
    (1-gamma)*y{1}/k * dA{1} = r + delta;
    k = (1-delta)*(k{-1}/dA) + i;

    log(dA) = log(g) + u;

    y = c + i;

%% Control linearized vs log-linearized variables
%
% In a stationary model, it does not matter much whether the variables are
% linearized or log-linearized. We log-linearized most of them here for two
% reasons:
%
% # to make the outcomes of the various experiments directly comparable
% with the outcomes of the unit-root version of the model,
% `exog_growth_unit_root.model`;
%
% # because the shock responses, autocovariance functions, and other
% characteristics can then directly interpreted in terms of percent
% fluctuations in the variables (which is what we do most of the time in
% economics).
