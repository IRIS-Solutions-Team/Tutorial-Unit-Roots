% IRIS Tutorial: Unit Root Models
%
% Int this tutorial, we show how to build and handle models with unit-root
% variables, such as balanced-growth path models. In IRIS, unit-root models
% do not need to be stationarized, and can be built, simulated and analyzed
% with the variables in their original levels.
%
%
% All Matlab programs and model files in this tutorial are also available
% as html files.
%
%
% __Model Files__
%
% Model files can be opened and edited in the Matlab editor (or any other
% plain text editor), but are not run themselves. They are read from
% within Matlab programs (m-files).
%
%   exog_growth_stationarized.model   - 
%   exog_growth_unit_root.model       - 
%
%
%
% __Matlab Programs__
%
% Open and run the m-files in the following order:
%
%   read_models                   - Read different versions of the same model
%   compare_shock_simulations     - Compare shock simulations in stationarised and unit-root models
%   compare_acf                   - Compare Autocovariance Functions of Stationarised and Unit-Root Models
